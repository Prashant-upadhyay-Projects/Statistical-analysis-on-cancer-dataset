# ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis on Cancer Dataset

## ðŸ‘‹ Overview
This repository presents an applied **statistical analysis project** on a real-world cancer dataset.  
The project demonstrates my ability to combine **statistical modelling, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data visualization** into a structured, insight-driven report.

All project assets are included:
- **Sanitized PDF Report** â€” polished version of the analysis
- **Code Files** â€” R and/or Python scripts
- **Excel Files** â€” cleaned dataset(s) used for analysis

This repo is designed as a portfolio project to showcase my ability to handle **end-to-end data analysis**: from exploratory statistics to communicating insights through clear visualizations and structured reporting.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Tools Demonstrated
- **Programming & Analysis:** R (ggplot2, PerformanceAnalytics), Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- **Statistics:** Descriptive Statistics, Correlation, Linear Regression, Hypothesis Testing (Welch Two-Sample t-test), Normality Testing (QQ-plots)  
- **Data Handling:** Excel, CSV, dataset preprocessing and cleaning  
- **Visualization & Reporting:** ggplot2 charts, regression plots, distribution analysis, academic-style reporting in PDF format

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
1. **Tumor Thickness Differences** â€” Statistically significant gender-based difference (p = 0.010), with males showing higher average thickness.  
2. **Survival Time Differences** â€” Females exhibited longer survival times on average (p = 0.038).  
3. **Age Factor** â€” Weak correlations observed with survival time and tumor thickness, highlighting limited predictive power.  
4. **Clinical Context** â€” Statistical significance does not always equal clinical significance; importance of contextual interpretation.
